```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This R package serves the spatial bounding box definitions we use in the Record Lab.

### Requirements

 + [R v4+](https://www.r-project.org/)
 
 + [rlang](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rlang)
 
 + [dplyr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr)
 
 + [sf](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sf)
 
### Suggested

 + [leaflet](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=leaflet)

### Installation

```
remotes::install_github("BigelowLab/cofbb")
```

### Usage

Retrieve a table of all known bounding boxes.

```{r get_table}
cofbb::get_table()
```

Retrieve one or more regions by name as a table.

```{r get_bb_table}
cofbb::get_bb(c("world", "nwa2"), form = "table")
```

Retrieve one or more regions by name as a list of vector in `[xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax]` order.

```{r get_bb_list}
cofbb::get_bb(c("world", "nwa2"), form = "bb")
```

Or retrieve just one as a vector
```{r get_bb_vector}
cofbb::get_bb("gom", form = "bb")
```

### Ancillary Functions

There are also functions for making `[-180, 180]` <-> `[0,360]` longitude transformations (`to_180BB()`, `to_360BB()`), splitting bounding boxes (`bb_split()`) and determining if a box straddles a particular line of longitude (`bb_straddles()`).

### [sf](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sf)

You can also retrieve bounding boxes as a data frame of one or more [sf](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sf) POLYGON objects. 

```{r get_sf}
x <- cofbb::get_bb(c("gosl", "gom", "nwa2"), form = "sf")
x
```

If you have [leaflet](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=leaflet) installed you can draw a pretty map (otherwise a boring map is drawn.)

```
plot_bb(x)
```
